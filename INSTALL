// STEP ONE - COPY TO DOCROOT
/////////////////////////////

	Copy the contents of the tracmor directory to the ROOT level of your web sites 
	DOCROOT	(also known as DocumentRoot, webroot, wwwroot, etc., depending on which 
	platform you are using).

	Even though we're assuming the entire contents of tracmor/ is in your DOCROOT,
	you can feel free to put it in a subdirectory WITHIN DOCROOT if you wish.

/////////////////////////////////
// STEP TWO - SET UP THE DATABASE
/////////////////////////////////

	Create a MySQL database called 'tracmor' (or another name of your choosing).  On 
	this database,  execute first the "create" and then "data" SQL script from the 
	tracmor/data_model directory.
	
////////////////////////////////////////////
// STEP THREE - UPDATE configuration.inc.php
////////////////////////////////////////////

	Inside of tracmor/includes you'll find the configuration.inc.php file.  You'll need
	to open it to specify the actual location of your __DOCROOT__.

	IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS:
	Please note that all paths should use standard "forward" slashes instead of
	"backslashes".  So windows paths would look like "c:/wwwroot" instead of
	"c:\wwwroot".

	Also, if you are putting Tracmor into a SUBDIRECTORY of DOCROOT, then be sure
	to set the __SUBDIRECTORY__ constant to whatever the subdirectory is
	within DOCROOT.

	If you are using Tracmor inside of a Virtual Directory (also known as a Directory
	Alias), be sure to specify the __VIRTUAL_DIRECTORY__ constant, too.

	Finally, be sure to update the DB_CONNECTION_1 serialized array constant with the
	correct database connection information for your tracmor database.
	

To begin using Tracmor,  navigate to the URL corresponding to your Tracmor install in
a web browser.  The default username and password are both 'admin'.
